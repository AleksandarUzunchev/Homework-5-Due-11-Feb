1. User Account Management:
Given an array of user objects, each containing a username and age property, 
create a new array containing only the usernames of users who are above 18 years old. 
Then sort the usernames alphabetically.

2. Message Filtering:

3. Product Pricing:

4. Employee Salary Calculation:
   Given an array of employee objects, each containing a name, salary, and department
